## Instructions to Run the Project

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. **Open the Files in a Browser:**  
   Navigate to the project folder and open any `.html` file in your web browser:  
   - `home.html` for the homepage.  
   - `projects.html` for the projects showcase.  
   - `articles.html` for articles and blog posts.  
   - `contact.html` for the contact form.  

3. **Modify the Content (Optional):**  
   You can edit the `.html` files to update content as per your needs. Use a text editor like Visual Studio Code or Sublime Text.

4. **Use the Hide/Show Articles Button:**  
   On the `articles.html` page, a button allows you to dynamically hide or show the articles section. This is achieved using JavaScript for interactivity.
